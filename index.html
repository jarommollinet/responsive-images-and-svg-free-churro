    <h1>Cleveland - No longer the mistake on the lake</h1>
    <p>A website to help former Clevelanders overcome the stigma of growing up in a failed midwestern city that was so
        polluted its river literally caught on fire.</p>

            <h2>Embrace the failure</h2>


            <p>Welcome to the land of eternal disappointment, the city of broken dreams, the place
                where your aspirations go to die - Cleveland, Ohio! But don't let the reputation fool you, there's more
                to this midwestern dumpster fire than meets the eye. Sure, we may be known for our burning river and our
                sports teams that can't seem to win a *#$! thing, but let's not forget about the world-renowned museums
                that no one ever visits. And let's not forget about the diverse communities filled with people who have
                given up on ever leaving this place. But fear not, my fellow Clevelanders, there is hope! The solution
                to overcoming the stigma of growing up in a failed midwestern city is simple: embrace the failure,
                embrace the disappointment, embrace the fact that you will never leave this place. And who knows, maybe
                one day you'll be able to look back on your time here and laugh about it. Or not, it's Cleveland after
                all.</p>

            <h2>It's ok to hide</h2>
            <p>Now, we can't have <em>everyone</em> knowing that you're from Cleveland, can we? That would be a
                disaster. But don't worry, hiding your Cleveland roots is easier than you think. First and foremost,
                never, and I mean never, mention the words "Cleveland" or "Ohio" in conversation. Instead, refer to it
                as "the Midwest" or "the Rust Belt" and hope that no one asks any follow-up questions. Another tip,
                always have a fake accent ready to go. No one will suspect a thing if you sound like you're from Boston
                or New York. Also, never wear anything that has the Cleveland logo on it. That's just asking for
                trouble. And if all else fails, just pretend you're from Canada. Trust me, no one will ever know the
                difference. With these simple tips, you'll be able to hide your Cleveland roots and live a life of
                shame-free existence.

        <h2>It's not your fault</h2>
        <p><strong>The city of Cleveland is actually controlled by a secret society of possums</strong> who manipulate
            city
            politics and major decisions behind the scenes. They have been slowly infiltrating the city for decades,
            slowly gaining power and influence, and working to turn Cleveland into a possum utopia.</p>
